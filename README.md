Low Pin Count Demo Board Lessons
================================

These are the lessons that came with the PICkit 2 Low Pin Count Demo Board Bundle.
The lessons are written in assembly language and originally made available as *MPLAB v8.00 Projects*.
All the projects were upgraded to work with the new **MPLAB X 4.10**.

The documentation is included.
No compilers are needed, as mpasm is already included in the MPLAB X installation.

The projects use **PIC16F690** and ICD 4 for programming, but you can change to whatever you like.
